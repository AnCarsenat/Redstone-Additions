# /ra_sensors:blocks/entity_detector/goggles
# Goggles readout for this block, and the block's display name.
# Context: as the block's marker, at the block position.
#
# The name is published to storage ra:temp block_name before anything is
# drawn, and the function stops there when the caller only wants the name.
# That makes this the single source of the name: ra:tools/block_name reuses
# the same dispatch to answer the Data Handlers, which used to carry two
# separate hand-written name tables that had already drifted apart.
